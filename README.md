## Changelog

**Fillraidbots 2.0.0**

    🆕 Added: A debugger window for when debugging is enabled. All debug messages are now sent here instead of cluttering the chat window.
    🆕 Added: A version checker that notifies you if a newer version of the addon is available.
    🆕 Added: Logic to distribute healers evenly across the raid when bots are added.
    🆕 Added: Class and role detection in the raid, enabling new functionality such as managing bots based on their roles.
    🆕 Added: A new "Refill Raid" button, which replaces bots that die and are removed during gameplay.
    🛠 Fixed: The /uninviteraid slash handler to prevent conflicts with WoW's native commands like /kick and /uninvite, which were unintentionally uninviting the entire raid. (Reported by Gemma)
    🔄 Version updated: From 1.2.0 to 2.0.0, marking this as a major update due to significant new features and functionality improvements.

**Fillraidbots 1.2.0**

    🛠 Fixed: Since the latest server update, which prevents adding bots while in combat, an issue occurred where adding certain bots, such as warriors or hunters, caused you to enter combat for a few seconds. This created a problem where the addon attempted to add bots when they couldn't be added. I have now fixed it so that the addon detects when you're in combat and pauses until you're out of combat.

    🛠 Added: The ability to move the 'fill raid' and 'kick all' buttons if this is enabled in the settings."

    🛠 Added: A version number to the FillRaidFrame so that it's easier to see which version you're using.

    🔄 Version updated: Incremented from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0 to reflect both the addition of new features (movable buttons and visible version number) and the resolution of a bug related to combat behavior. This update introduces functional improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Fillraidbots 1.1.0**

    🛠 Added: : Checks if you are in a raid and there is still 1 old bot remaining. Removes the old bot when there are 10 new bots in the raid.

    🛠 Added: : If you are playing with someone else and are not the leader or an officer, the "remove bot" function is disabled.

    🔄 Version updated: From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, indicating bug fixes.
